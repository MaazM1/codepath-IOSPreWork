# Prework - *TesterApp*

Submitted by: **Maaz Mansuri**

**TesterApp** is an app that features 3 labels, each stating my name, the university I attend, and the profession I aspire to be in. In addition, TesterApp features a button and a slider. The button labeled "RANDOM" changes the background to a random color when pressed, the slider feature, named "Opacity Slider" allows for the adjustment of the Opacity for the color. The slider was a feature I personally in addition to the required prework. [TODO]

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

    - Pinpointing messages with paramters like dates, sender, reciever, or what the message contains
    - Profile customizability, adding animations and custom banners to profiles
    - Customizable animated emotes
- Apple Maps
    - Extremely accurate time estimations on arrival
    - Traffic calculator to plan better trips
    - Overall navigation

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
- Issues finding correct buttons, navigating xCode as a whole. 
- When trying to add my slider feature, I had issues opening up the assistant so that I can link my slider to the code, same as I did with the button.
