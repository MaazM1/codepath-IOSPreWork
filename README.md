# Prework - *TesterApp*

Submitted by: **Maaz Mansuri**

**TesterApp** is an app that features 3 labels, each stating my name, the university I attend, and the profession I aspire to be in. In addition, TesterApp features a button and a slider. The button labeled "RANDOM" changes the background to a random color when pressed, the slider feature, named "Opacity Slider" allows for the adjustment of the Opacity for the color. The slider was a feature I personally added in addition to the required prework.  

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:
